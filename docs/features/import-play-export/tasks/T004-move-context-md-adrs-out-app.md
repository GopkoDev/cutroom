# T004 — Move `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs out of the app and up to the repository root, since they describe the whole…

## Place in the sequence

- **Blocked by:** — · **Blocks:** — · **Wave:** Spec Kit Phase 1 — Setup (Shared Infrastructure) (phase order 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6).
- **Lane:** own lane.

## Why (user story)

No single user story. This is Phase 1 (Setup (Shared Infrastructure)) infrastructure that every story stands on; the phase's purpose is quoted in [_epic.md](./_epic.md#spec-kit-breakdown-notes-verbatim).

## Inlined context

> **Implementation record** (the Spec Kit task line, with its done note):
>
> [x] T004 Move `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs out of the app and up to the repository root, since they describe the whole monorepo — **done ahead of the others**, so that the constitution and this feature's documents do not point at paths that stop existing at T003

**Fallback:** insufficient or contradicted by the code → read the named file in full
([spec.md](../spec.md) · [sad.md](../sad.md) · [data-model.md](../data-model.md) ·
[events.md](../contracts/events.md) · [public-api.md](../contracts/public-api.md) · [docs/adr/](../../../adr/)) and follow it. Do not guess.

## Data delta

No DB changes.

## API contract

Internal — no API surface.

## Acceptance criteria

None — infrastructure, measurement or documentation task; no spec §5 criterion is satisfied by it alone (the Spec Kit breakdown tied it to no FR or acceptance scenario).

## Checklist

- [x] Move `CONTEXT.md` and the ADRs out of the app and up to the repository root, since they describe the whole monorepo

## Edge cases

| Case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No negative branch in this task's acceptance criteria | — (the cases it handled are in the implementation record above) |

## Definition of Done

- [x] Done as recorded in the Spec Kit note (Phase 1, commits 35a3596, f554804, 78604a6, d8af2fe, 565b695).
- [x] Delivered in Spec Kit Phase 1 (Setup (Shared Infrastructure)), commits 35a3596, f554804, 78604a6, d8af2fe, 565b695
